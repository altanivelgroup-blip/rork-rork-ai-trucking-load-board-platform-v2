# Photo Uploader & Driver Profile Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **PhotoUploader not working** - Photos buffer indefinitely without progress
2. **Driver profile not saving** - Permission denied errors when saving driver profile
3. **Root cause**: Firebase authentication state not properly verified before upload attempts

## Fixes Applied

### 1. PhotoUploader Component (`components/PhotoUploader.tsx`)

#### Enhanced Authentication Checks
- Added explicit check for `auth.currentUser` before attempting upload
- Added detailed logging of authentication state at upload time
- Logs now include: uid, email, isAnonymous status, and upload path

#### Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages that guide users to sign out/in if permission denied
- Detailed error logging including error code, message, name, and stack trace
- Captures auth state in error handler to diagnose permission issues

#### Better Logging
```typescript
console.log('[PhotoUploader] Upload details:', {
  path: fullPath,
  uid,
  role,
  context,
  safeId,
  isAuthenticated: !!auth.currentUser,
  userEmail: auth.currentUser?.email,
});
```

### 2. Storage Rules (`storage.rules`)

#### Tightened Security
Changed from:
```
match /profiles/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
  allow write: if isAuthenticated();
}
```

To:
```
match /profiles/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
  allow write: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

This ensures users can only upload to their own profile directory.

### 3. Firestore Rules (`firestore.rules`)

Already correctly configured:
```
match /drivers/{uid} {
  allow read: if isOwner(uid) || isAdmin();
  allow write: if isAuthenticatedUser() && isOwner(uid);
  allow create: if isAuthenticatedUser() && isOwner(uid);
}
```

### 4. Driver Profile Save (`lib/firebase.ts`)

The `saveDriverProfile` function already has:
- Proper authentication checks via `ensureFirebaseAuth()`
- User ID validation to prevent cross-user writes
- Detailed error logging with error codes
- Proper error messages for different failure scenarios

## How It Works Now

### Photo Upload Flow
1. User selects photo from gallery or camera
2. PhotoUploader checks if user is authenticated
3. If not authenticated, shows clear error message
4. If authenticated, compresses image
5. Generates unique photo ID and storage path
6. Uploads to Firebase Storage at `profiles/{uid}/{context}/{photoId}.ext`
7. Shows progress bar during upload
8. Returns download URL on success

### Driver Profile Save Flow
1. User fills out profile form
2. Clicks "Save Profile" button
3. Form validates required fields
4. Calls `saveDriverProfile()` with user data
5. Function checks Firebase authentication
6. Validates user can only save their own profile
7. Writes to `drivers/{uid}` collection
8. Also updates `users/{uid}` for compatibility
9. Updates local cache for offline support
10. Shows success toast

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign in as driver
- [ ] Navigate to driver profile page
- [ ] Fill out profile information
- [ ] Click "Save Profile" - should succeed
- [ ] Add photos using "Choose Photos" button
- [ ] Verify photos upload with progress bar
- [ ] Verify photos appear in gallery
- [ ] Remove a photo - should delete from storage
- [ ] Sign out and sign back in
- [ ] Verify profile data persists
- [ ] Verify photos persist

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Permission denied" on photo upload
**Solution**: Sign out and sign back in to refresh authentication token

### Issue: "Not signed in" error
**Solution**: Ensure user is authenticated before accessing driver profile page

### Issue: Photos buffer indefinitely
**Solution**: Check console logs for detailed error information. Look for:
- `[PhotoUploader] No authenticated user`
- `[PhotoUploader] Permission denied - auth state:`

### Issue: Driver profile doesn't save
**Solution**: Check console logs for:
- `[SAVE_DRIVER_PROFILE] ❌ Failed to save driver profile:`
- Look at error code (permission-denied, unavailable, unauthenticated)

## Architecture Notes

### Storage Paths
- **Profile photos**: `profiles/{uid}/vehicle/{photoId}.jpg`
- **Document photos**: `profiles/{uid}/document/{photoId}.jpg`
- **Load photos**: `loads/{loadId}/{role}/{uid}/{photoId}.jpg`

### Firestore Collections
- **Driver profiles**: `drivers/{uid}`
- **User metadata**: `users/{uid}`
- **Vehicles**: `drivers/{uid}/vehicles/{vehicleId}`

### Security Model
- Users can only read/write their own profile data
- Users can only upload to their own storage paths
- All reads are public (for shipper visibility)
- Admins have full access to all data

## Next Steps

1. Deploy updated storage rules to Firebase Console
2. Test photo upload on both web and mobile
3. Test driver profile save/load cycle
4. Monitor console logs for any remaining issues
5. Consider adding retry logic for failed uploads
6. Consider adding offline queue for uploads

## Files Modified

1. `components/PhotoUploader.tsx` - Enhanced logging and error handling
2. `storage.rules` - Tightened security rules
3. `lib/firebase.ts` - Already had proper checks (no changes needed)
4. `hooks/useAuth.tsx` - Already had proper driver profile loading (no changes needed)

## Deployment Notes

**IMPORTANT**: After deploying code changes, you MUST deploy the updated storage rules:

```bash
firebase deploy --only storage
```

Or deploy via Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Storage > Rules
3. Copy contents of `storage.rules`
4. Click "Publish"
