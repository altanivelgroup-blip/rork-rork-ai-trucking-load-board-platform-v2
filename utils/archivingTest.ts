/**
 * NEW ARCHIVING LOGIC SUMMARY:
 * 
 * 1. ONLY archives loads that are:
 *    - Status = 'completed' OR 'archived'
 *    - AND delivery date is more than 7 days ago
 * 
 * 2. PREVENTS premature archiving by:
 *    - Ignoring loads with status 'available', 'in-transit', etc.
 *    - Using 7-day window instead of 36-hour window
 *    - Adding detailed logging for transparency
 * 
 * 3. IMPROVED VISIBILITY:
 *    - Loads remain visible until explicitly completed
 *    - Clear logging shows which loads are archived vs. kept visible
 *    - Easy rollback with backup files created

 * Scenario 3: Load completed 10 days ago
 * - Status: 'completed', delivery: 10 days ago
 * - Result: ARCHIVED (completed + past 7-day window)
 * 
 * Scenario 4: Load available but delivery was 10 days ago
 * - Status: 'available', delivery: 10 days ago
 * - Result: REMAINS VISIBLE (not completed, still active)
